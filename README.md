Implementation of a program for solving search problems, a core problem in the field of artificial intelligence. In the course of working on this assignment, youâ€™ll implement a more efficient queue module using two stacks; create a higher-order functor that abstracts away details of search algorithms and puzzle implementations; and compare, visualize, and analyze the performance of various search algorithms on different puzzles.
